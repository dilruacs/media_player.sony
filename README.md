# media_player.sony

## Important!

The device needs to be in the same subnet as the Home Assistant software.
This is a limitation of the Sony Firmware, the device will not react properly to requests if the client is in a different subnet.

## Getting Started

To get started put :
* `/custom_components/sony/*` here: `<config_directory>/custom_components/sony`

When using home assistant supervised put the  contents of this repo into ````/usr/share/hassio/homeassistant/````

## Configuration

You will need to configure your device to allow the Home Assistant for remote usage. To do that, ensure that your device is turned on.
To add a device to your installation, add the Sony Legacy from integration section, then fill in the IP address or hostname of your device (it should be a static IP in your network)
Don't modify the other values and click next. After that, the device will show you a PIN and Home Assistant will allow you to re-enter that PIN.
You should be able to see the PIN code on your TV screen and type it in, then validate and that's all.
